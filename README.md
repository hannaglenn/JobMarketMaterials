# Job Market Materials - 2024/2025

My name is Hanna Glenn; I graduated from Emory University with a PhD in Economics in 2025. This repository contains everything from my job market journey... advice, materials, timing, thoughts, feelings. Everyone's job market is unique, and what worked for me won't for everybody. But I remember approaching the job market and still not grasping what it would actually be like, so I'm happy to share as much detail as I can. 

I primarily used [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) and Excel to organize materials and schedules.

## Timeline

This is generally when the major segments of the job market took place for me. I accepted a job in January, so the end dates could extend further in other circumstances. Prior to the COVID pandemic, schedules were much more rigid around the AEA meetings. Even though that same timeline is strongly suggested for employers, I experienced a lot of early movers. I forsee the timeline unraveling even more in the coming years. 

*Draft of job market paper finished*: August 1   
*Work on application documents*: August - September   
*Submit applications*: September - December (but mostly done by end of November)   
*First round interviews*: late October - December   
*Flyouts*: November - January   

## Prior to the Market

Before looking at a single job posting, I spent a day thinking about what I really wanted in a job. Several trusted mentors explained to me the importance of knowing what would make me happy before I'm faced with a decision. I did not take this to mean that I would necessarily get the job that would make me the most happy, but that if I was faced with a decision between two relatively similar jobs, I would know which aspects to weight more heavily in the decision. 

First, and most impactful, I ranked the following aspects in order of importance to me. The end result was not exactly what I imagined it would be once I really sat down and thought about it, so don't brush this off or only put what you think your advisor wants for you. 
- maintaining an active research agenda
- location
- a balanced lifestyle
- discretionary time
- opportunities for continued growth
- teaching
- building wealth
- a secure/stable future
- helping others
- setting down roots and starting a family
- helping society
- doing cutting edge research
- working with the leaders in your field
- world class resources
- working for a prestigious institution

Then, I filled out this [skills sheet](https://multco-web7-psh-files-usw2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/career-management/documents/skill-inventory-smith-college.pdf). Once I completed it, I connected each section to my experiences in graduate school, and I was able to clearly see which areas my skills matched with things that I really enjoyed doing. For example, one of my favorite jobs in graduate school was helping undergrad honors students with their theses, which I connected to my skills in interpersonal relationships and detail & completion. I made a note of these crossovers to (1) reference in interviews later, and (2) look for those types of experiences as indicators that I was interested in a job. 

If your University offers workshops on strengths or personality testing, you should aboslutely take advantage of those resources as well. Knowing about yourself and your preferences only makes you a stronger candidate for the jobs that align with them.
