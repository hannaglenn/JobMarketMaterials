# Job Market Materials - 2024/2025

My name is Hanna Glenn; I graduated from Emory University with a PhD in Economics in 2025. This repository contains everything from my job market journey... advice, materials, timing, thoughts, feelings. Everyone's job market is unique, and what worked for me won't for everybody. But I remember approaching the job market and still not grasping what it would actually be like, so I'm happy to share as much detail as I can. I applied to *every* job that I was qualified for. While I primarily targeted research-oriented academic jobs, I interviewed for research, government, liberal arts, and industry jobs. 

I primarily used [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) and Excel to organize materials and schedules.

## Timeline

This is generally when the major segments of the job market took place for me. I accepted a job in January, so the end dates could extend further in other circumstances. Prior to the COVID pandemic, schedules were much more rigid around the AEA meetings. Even though that same timeline is strongly suggested for employers, I experienced a lot of early movers. I forsee the timeline unraveling even more in the coming years. 

*Draft of job market paper finished*: August 1   
*Work on application documents*: August - September   
*Submit applications*: September - December (but mostly done by end of November)   
*First round interviews*: late October - December   
*Flyouts*: November - January   

## Prior to the Market

Before looking at a single job posting, I spent a significant amount of time processing what I really wanted in a job. Several trusted mentors explained to me the importance of knowing what would make me happy before I'm faced with a decision between two options. I did not take this to mean that I would necessarily get the job that would make me the most happy, but that if I was faced with a decision between two relatively similar jobs, I would know which aspects to weigh more heavily in the decision. 

First, and most impactful, I ranked the following aspects in order of importance to me. After really sitting down and thinking about it, the end result surprised me a bit. Try to be honest with yourself and separate what you want from what you think other people might want for you.
- maintaining an active research agenda
- location
- a balanced lifestyle
- discretionary time
- opportunities for continued growth
- teaching
- building wealth
- a secure/stable future
- helping others
- setting down roots and starting a family
- helping society
- doing cutting edge research
- working with the leaders in your field
- world class resources
- working for a prestigious institution

Then, I filled out this [skills sheet](https://multco-web7-psh-files-usw2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/career-management/documents/skill-inventory-smith-college.pdf). Once I completed it, I connected each section to my experiences in graduate school, and I was able to clearly see which areas my skills matched with things that I really enjoyed doing. For example, one of my favorite jobs in graduate school was helping undergrad honors students with their theses, which I connected to my skills in interpersonal relationships and detail & completion. I made a note of these crossovers to (1) reference in interviews later, and (2) look for similar opportunities in jobs. I also took this [interests quiz](https://nccareers.org/find-career/interest-finder). 

If your University offers workshops on strengths or personality tests, you should aboslutely take advantage of those resources as well. Knowing about yourself and your preferences only makes you a stronger candidate for the jobs that align with them. 

## Documents

The basic items you should prepare before you begin applications are: (1) research statement, (2) teaching statement, (3) diversity and inclusion statement (4) several cover letter templates, (5) CV, (6) website. I will speak in detail about each of these below. 

#### Research Statement

My research statement is linked [here](Sample-Documents/Research-Statement.pdf). The purpose of this document is to show that your past and current research is high quality, and that you have a plan to continue high quality research in the future. While it seems like a small thing, I really liked the idea of bolding paper titles in this document to give readers an anchor for each section. 

#### Teaching Statement

One version of my teaching statement is linked [here](Sample-Documents/Teaching-Statement.pdf). I found that this was the document I needed to tailor to different jobs most often. I ended up with a 1,2, and 3 page version, and different versions that focused on graduate or undergraduate teaching. I woudn't worry about having all of those upfront, but be aware that you may need to create different versions later. My goals in writing my teaching statement were to show that I am passionate about educating students well, and that I have diverse experiences teaching in different settings. For me, this included research about pedagogy and including sample syllabus material. This is not always necessary, and many jobs will ask you to submit a syllabus separately from the teaching statement. 

#### Diversity and Inclusion Statement

This can be a sometimes be a really challenging document to write! My statement is linked [here](Sample-Documents/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Statement.pdf). I focused on my experiences teaching diverse student populations, and how my research agenda relates to diversity. 

#### Cover Letter Templates

I applied to every job I felt qualified for (this resulted in almost 300 applications). I am aware of the debate on whether to spend time customizing cover letters... for me, it was worth the extra time for the peace of mind that I didn't get denied just because of a generic cover letter. I made customization easier by starting with 4 cover letter templates that I used as a base for each application: [academic](Sample-Documents/Academic-Cover-Letter.pdf), [teaching](Sample-Documents/Teaching-Cover-Letter.pdf), postdoc, and industry. These are largely similar, but the order in which you talk about things is important (start with teaching for a liberal arts position!). I tried to add an attribute of the department and an attribute of the location that I was drawn to for each position. The most important thing here is to make sure you don't forget to change the name of the institution!!!

#### CV

A polished CV is a must before submitting applications, but the good thing is this is a document you will likely not have to change again once it's done. My job market CV is linked [here](Sample-Documents/CV.pdf). 

#### Website

A polished website is also very important. I used Alex Hollingsworth's [job market website guide](https://hollina.github.io/make-a-job-market-website.html). I also added a page for interests outside of academics, which I think can be a way for people to connect with you before meeting you. Most people focus on adding their publications and research papers, but I think it is valuable to put effort into the teaching section as well, especially if you are applying for teaching-focused positions. For example, adding syllabi, student quotes, etc. 

#### Video Presentation of Job Market Paper (Optional)

Many applications have an option to upload a short video of you explaining your job market paper. This can be helpful to show that you are well-spoken and can explain your research concisely. I tried both with and without slides, and found that having slides helped my flow a lot. I'm honestly unsure if this actually contributes to whether someone is chosen for an interview or not, but a good quality video can't hurt. My video is linked here.
