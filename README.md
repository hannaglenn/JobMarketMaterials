# Job Market Materials - 2024/2025

My name is Hanna Glenn; I graduated from Emory University with a PhD in Economics in 2025. This repository contains everything from my job market journey... advice, materials, timing, thoughts, feelings. Everyone's job market is unique, and what worked for me won't for everybody. But I remember approaching the job market and still not grasping what it would actually be like, so I'm happy to share as much detail as I can. I applied to *every* job that I was qualified for (almost 300 applications submitted). I got interviews for diverse positions in research, government, liberal arts institutions, research institutions, and private industry. However, most of my experience is centered around academic positions, especially for late-round interviews and flyouts. 

I primarily used [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) and Excel to organize materials and schedules.

## Timeline

This is generally when the major segments of the job market took place for me. I accepted a job in January, so the end dates could extend further in other circumstances. Prior to the COVID pandemic, schedules were much more rigid around the in-person AEA meetings. Even though interviews have moved to Zoom, the same timeline is strongly suggested for employers. However, I experienced several early movers and exploding offers. I forsee the timeline unraveling even more in the coming years. 

*Draft of job market paper finished*: August 1   
*Work on application documents*: August - September   
*Submit applications*: September - December (but mostly done by end of November)   
*First round interviews*: late October - December   
*Flyouts*: November - January   

## Prior to the Market

Before looking at a single job posting, I spent a significant amount of time processing what I really wanted in a job. Several trusted mentors explained to me the importance of knowing what would make me happy before I'm faced with a decision between two options. I did not take this to mean that I would necessarily get the job that would make me the most happy, but that if I was faced with a decision between two relatively similar jobs, I would know which aspects to weigh more heavily in the decision. While I found this helpful, I also think it's important to keep an open mind when going on flyouts that aren't your first choice, sometimes it's the gut feeling that helps you make a decision! 

First, and most impactful, I ranked the following aspects in order of importance to me. After really sitting down and thinking about it, the end result surprised me a bit. Try to be honest with yourself and disentangle what you want from what you think other people might want for you.
- maintaining an active research agenda
- location
- a balanced lifestyle
- discretionary time
- opportunities for continued growth
- teaching
- building wealth
- a secure/stable future
- helping others
- setting down roots and starting a family
- helping society
- doing cutting edge research
- working with the leaders in your field
- world class resources
- working for a prestigious institution

Then, I filled out this [skills sheet](https://multco-web7-psh-files-usw2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/career-management/documents/skill-inventory-smith-college.pdf). Once I completed it, I connected each section to my experiences in graduate school, and I was able to clearly see which areas my skills matched with things that I really enjoyed doing. For example, one of my favorite jobs in graduate school was helping undergrad honors students with their theses, which I connected to my skills in interpersonal relationships and detail & completion. I made a note of these crossovers as elements I should look for in job postings/department attributes. This also turns into a useful tool to reference your strengths later on in interviews. I also took this [interests quiz](https://nccareers.org/find-career/interest-finder). 

If your University offers workshops on strengths or personality tests, you should aboslutely take advantage of those resources as well. Knowing about yourself and your preferences only makes you a stronger candidate for the jobs that align with them. 

## Documents and Materials 

The basic items you should prepare before you begin applications are: (1) research statement, (2) teaching statement, (3) diversity and inclusion statement (4) several cover letter templates, (5) CV, (6) website. I will speak in detail about each of these below. 

#### Research Statement

My research statement is linked [here](Sample-Documents/Research-Statement.pdf). The purpose of this document is to show that your past and current research is already high quality, and that you have a plan to continue high quality research in the future. While it seems like a small thing, I really liked the idea of bolding paper titles in this document to give readers an anchor for each section. 

#### Teaching Statement

One version of my teaching statement is linked [here](Sample-Documents/Teaching-Statement.pdf). I found that this was the document I needed to tailor to different jobs most often. I ended up with a 1, 2, and 3 page version, and different versions that focused on graduate or undergraduate teaching. I woudn't worry about having all of those upfront, but be aware that you may need to create different versions later. My goals in writing my teaching statement were to show that I am passionate about educating students well, and that I have diverse experiences teaching in different settings. For me, this included pedagogy and including sample syllabus material. This is not always necessary, and many jobs will ask you to submit a syllabus separately from the teaching statement. 

#### Diversity and Inclusion Statement

This can be a challenging document to write! My statement is linked [here](Sample-Documents/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Statement.pdf), and I focused on my experiences teaching diverse student populations, and how my research agenda relates to diversity. 

#### Cover Letter Templates

I applied to every job I felt qualified for (this resulted in almost 300 applications). I am aware of the debate on whether to spend time customizing cover letters... to me, it was worth the extra time for the peace of mind that I didn't get denied just because of a generic cover letter. I made customization easier by starting with 4 cover letter templates that I used as a base: [academic](Sample-Documents/Academic-Cover-Letter.pdf), [teaching](Sample-Documents/Teaching-Cover-Letter.pdf), [postdoc](Sample-Documents/postdoc-Cover-Letter.pdf), and [industry](Sample-Documents/industry-Cover-Letter.pdf). These are largely similar, but the order in which you talk about things is important (*start* with teaching for a liberal arts position!). I tried to add an attribute of the department and an attribute of the location that I was drawn to for each position. The most important thing here is to make sure you don't forget to change the institution-specific details!

I also included [Latex template files](Sample-Docuemts/Cover-Letter-Template-Tex) to include letterhead and signature on the cover letter. Simply replace all Emory-specific elements if you are at another University.

#### CV

A polished CV is a must before submitting applications, but the good thing is this is a document you will likely not have to change again once it's done. My job market CV is linked [here](Sample-Documents/CV.pdf), and the .tex file associated with it is linked [here](Sample-Documents/CV_tex.tex). 

#### Website

A polished website is also very important. I used Alex Hollingsworth's [job market website guide](https://hollina.github.io/make-a-job-market-website.html). I also added a page for interests outside of academics, which I think can be a way for people to connect with you before meeting you. Most people focus on adding their publications and research papers, but I think it is valuable to put effort into the teaching section as well, especially if you are applying for teaching-focused positions. For example, adding syllabi, student quotes, etc. For now, my website can be found at [hannaglenn.netlify.app](hannaglenn.netfliy.app). 

#### Video Presentation of Job Market Paper (Optional)

Many applications have an option to upload a short video of you explaining your job market paper. This can be helpful to show that you are well-spoken and can explain your research concisely. I tried both with and without slides, and found that having slides helped my flow a lot. At Emory, we have a [video recording studio](https://ats.emory.edu/sdl/production-studios/streaming_and_recording_studio/index.html) that students can reserve that has great lighting and a telemprompter. 

I'm honestly unsure if the video actually contributes to whether someone is chosen for an interview or not, but a good quality video can't hurt. My video is linked [here](https://hannaglenn.netlify.app/media/JMP_video.mp4). 

#### Recommendation Letters

I asked my committee for recommendation letters in mid-August. I sent them an email including my CV and research statement, along with a ranking of the types of jobs I was targeting. This helps your letter writers know whether to talk more about teaching, or provide a signal that you are serious about government jobs, etc. There are also instances where different versions of letters can be helpful. For example, I had a strong preference for non-US jobs, so my chair kindly wrote one letter for overseas positions to help me signal this. 

Every department handles the administration of recommendation letters a little differently. At Emory, they sent their letters to our department admisinitrator who handled them for the entirety of the market. Try to ask your committee members early so that they have plenty of time to write you a good letter before applications begin. 

## Applications

Once the time frame for application postings start, you'll see a lot of new postings every day. This can be really overwhelming without a system for organizing everything! I started an [excel sheet](Sample-Documents/Application-Tracking.xlsx) to keep track of every job I wanted to submit an application for. Every day, I would check [Econ Job Market](https://econjobmarket.org/positions) and [JOE](https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings), these are the most common job listing pages for economists. For any job that I was qualified for (so basically, not macro), I would add the information to my spreadsheet. This took about an hour a day during peak job market time. 

The most common deadline for applications is November 15. It can be tempting to put off submitting applications until closer to that deadline... but this can be stressful if you end up have 50 applications to complete in a week. To spread out the work, I committed to submitting at least 3 applications per day no matter what. I sorted the spreadsheet by nearest due date and would complete the first 3 applications. In the beginning, this was *very* time consuming as I was polishing documents and editing cover letters. But it got easier over time, and I was able to complete all 3 in around an hour per day. I was ahead of schedule for most of the market, and didn't have any stress during the November 15 deadline! 

Different departments also have different methods of reaching out to potential employers on your behalf. At Emory, your committee is mainly responsible for this aspect. My committee was amazing and reached out to anyone they knew with job openings. I wish I had done a better job of this, but it really helps to regularly update your committee about jobs you are particularly interested in. They may not know someone directly, but they might know someone who does. I did my best to send my committee an email every other week with new jobs I was drawn to. 

## First-Round Interviews

#### Preparing for Interviews

I created [one document](Sample-Documents/Interview-Questions.doc) in which I compiled a list of every general (not institution-specific) interview question I could find. I wrote out my answers to every single one of these questions and practiced them regularly. Give your close friends or family copies of this list and ask them to surprise you with questions at random times. I was asked almost all of these in at least one interview, so you should be prepared for all of them by the time you start doing Zoom interviews. 

In addition to this, you should have severl "pitches" completely memorized for interviews. The first is some version of "tell us about your job market paper", and the second is some version of "tell us about your research/dissertation". In a majority of my interviews, this is the first thing they ask. I prepared a 2-5 minute pitch of each of these questions and memorized them. You want to know them so well that they don't fly out of your brain in a moment of nervousness (which did happen to me a couple of times!).  

#### Organization

From this point onward is where [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) became my literal best friend. I created a Notion page specifically devoted to keeping track of and preparing for Zoom interviews. In one column, I created a page for every upcoming interview and sorted them by date, and once that interview was finished I would drag it to the finished column. 

![zoom-interview-notion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ccf523-85a7-4931-8d2f-6a0b3d35b7b3)

Within each interview page, I would complete additional preparation specific to the job. I would research the department, the research of specific people in the department, the institution and/or company, and answer more questions about why I thought the job would be a good fit. All of the information I gathered and questions I would answer are shown here: 

![zoom-interview-specific-notion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27520cda-84f5-4b88-adf0-4e49b85230eb)

At this point, you are ready for the interview! Be confident and genuine, half the battle of getting a job is showing that you would be a good colleague. 

#### Random Thoughts

Most first round interviews were 20-30 minutes, but I did have a handful of Zoom interviews last 45 minutes to an hour. 

There is generally mixed advice about whether to reveal certain aspects of yourself on in interviews/flyouts (if you have a partner on the market, if you're married, etc.) There is validity in a lot of this advice. I generally value the culture of a department more than prestige, so I followed my favorite advice on this topic, which is "if you don't get hired for a particular characteristic that is a big part of you, did you really want that job in the first place?".
