# Job Market Materials - 2024/2025

My name is Hanna Glenn, I am currently a Lecturer at the University of Queensland. I graduated from Emory University with a PhD in Economics in 2025. This repository contains everything from my job market journey... advice, materials, timing, thoughts, feelings. Everyone's job market journey is unique, and what worked for me won't for everybody. But I remember approaching the job market and still not grasping what it would actually be like, so I'm happy to share as much detail as I can.
